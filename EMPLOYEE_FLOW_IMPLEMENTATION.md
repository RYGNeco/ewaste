# Enhanced Employee Flow Implementation

## Overview

The employee flow has been enhanced to provide a comprehensive role request and management system. This document outlines the complete implementation.

## Employee Flow

### 1. Employee Registration
1. **Google OAuth**: Employee signs up using Google OAuth
2. **Profile Completion**: Redirected to `/complete-profile` to:
   - Select user type as "Employee"
   - Choose requested roles from: Admin, Inventory Manager, Transporter, Coordinator
   - Provide additional profile information
3. **Role Request Creation**: System automatically creates a role request with status "pending"
4. **Pending State**: Employee is redirected to `/pending-approval` page

### 2. Pending Approval Experience
- **Status Display**: Shows "Role Approval Pending" message
- **Request Details**: Displays requested roles and submission date
- **Next Steps**: Explains the approval process (1-2 business days)
- **Support Contact**: Option to contact support via email
- **Sign Out**: Ability to sign out if needed

### 3. Super Admin Role Management

#### Employee Management Dashboard
- **Employee Table**: View all employees with:
  - Name and email
  - Current role
  - Approval status (pending/approved/rejected)
  - Account status (active/inactive/pending)
  - Join date
  - Role change dropdown (Super Admin only)

#### Role Approval Interface
- **Pending Requests Table**: Shows all pending role requests
- **Approval Modal**: Interactive modal allowing Super Admin to:
  - Review requested roles
  - Select which roles to approve (can be subset of requested)
  - Approve with custom role selection
- **Rejection Modal**: Allows Super Admin to:
  - Provide detailed rejection reason
  - Explain why the request was denied

### 4. Post-Approval/Rejection Flow

#### Approved Employees
- **Automatic Redirect**: Approved employees are redirected to `/admin` dashboard
- **Role Assignment**: System assigns approved roles
- **Status Update**: Account status changed to "active"
- **Access Control**: Proper role-based access to admin features

#### Rejected Employees
- **Rejection Page**: Redirected to `/role-rejected` page showing:
  - Rejection reason from Super Admin
  - Next steps and options
  - Resubmission option
  - Support contact option

### 5. Role-Based Access Control

#### Super Admin
- Full system access
- Employee management
- Role approval/rejection
- User role changes

#### Regular Admin
- Standard admin dashboard access
- Cannot manage other employees
- Cannot approve role requests

#### Other Roles
- Role-specific access based on assigned permissions
- Inventory Manager: Inventory management features
- Transporter: Transportation and pickup features
- Coordinator: Coordination and scheduling features

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Features
1. **User Model**: Enhanced with role approval fields
2. **RoleRequest Model**: Tracks all role requests
3. **API Endpoints**:
   - `GET /api/role-requests/pending` - Get pending requests
   - `PUT /api/role-requests/:id/approve` - Approve request
   - `PUT /api/role-requests/:id/reject` - Reject request
   - `GET /api/users?userType=employee` - Get all employees
   - `PUT /api/users/:id/role` - Update user role

### Frontend Features
1. **Enhanced AdminPage**: Added employee management and role approval tabs
2. **Role Approval Modal**: Interactive approval interface with role selection
3. **Employee Management Table**: Comprehensive employee overview
4. **Role Change Dropdown**: Super Admin can change roles directly
5. **Status Indicators**: Visual status indicators throughout the interface

### Authentication Flow
1. **Google OAuth Integration**: Seamless authentication
2. **Profile Completion**: Guided setup process
3. **Role-Based Routing**: Automatic redirection based on user status
4. **Access Control**: Middleware-based permission checking

## Key Features

### ✅ Employee Role Request System
- Employees can request multiple roles
- Super Admin can approve subset of requested roles
- Detailed rejection reasons
- Resubmission capability

### ✅ Super Admin Dashboard
- Employee management table
- Role approval interface
- Real-time status updates
- Role change functionality

### ✅ Status Management

- Approval/rejection handling
- Visual status indicators
- Automatic redirections

### ✅ Enhanced User Experience

- Support contact options
- Responsive design

## Usage Instructions

### For Super Admins
1. Access the Admin dashboard
2. Navigate to "Employee Management" tab to view all employees
3. Navigate to "Role Approvals" tab to handle pending requests
4. Use approval modal to select roles and approve
5. Use rejection modal to provide detailed feedback
6. Use role dropdown to change existing employee roles

### For Employees
1. Sign up via Google OAuth
2. Complete profile and select desired roles
3. Wait for approval notification
4. If approved: Access role-based dashboard
5. If rejected: Review reason and resubmit if needed

## Environment Setup

The system works with the existing project structure. Key requirements:
- MongoDB for data storage
- Google OAuth configured
- JWT authentication
- Role-based middleware

## Security Considerations

1. **Role Validation**: All role changes validated server-side
2. **Super Admin Only**: Critical operations restricted to Super Admin
3. **JWT Authentication**: Secure token-based authentication
4. **Input Validation**: All user inputs validated and sanitized
5. **Access Control**: Route-level and component-level permission checks

This implementation provides a complete, production-ready employee management system with proper role-based access control and a user-friendly approval workflow.
